        \nEasyMath is a way to teach addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction skills in a fun
        and engaging way. Inspired by DigiDots, the students learn the position of dots and lines (forming an \'X\') on each digit.
        The number of marks on each digit corresponds to the value of the digit.
        To add, multiply, divide and subtract two digits together, students count the marks on each number to find the sum,
        the difference, product, and quotient.
        In \'Learn\' mode, students learn the placement of the dots and lines on the digits. In \'Practice\' mode, students have to remember
        where the dots and lines are. In \'Quiz\' mode, students get to apply what they have learned to answer ten
        problems of each math operation.\n\n
